This repository now hosts a small brick-breaking game. Open `index.html` in a browser to play.

Use the left and right arrow keys or the mouse scroll wheel to move the skateboard and bounce the football into the bricks. Regular bricks award +10 points, while green bricks marked "Q" give +50 points when hit. Once all bricks are destroyed, a congratulations message displays your final score. The game automatically expands to fill the entire browser window for a full-screen experience.

The configuration panel lets you choose skateboard size, the number of green quiz bricks, and a gravity value to control ball speed. Bricks are now half-width, doubling the total brick count for added challenge.
