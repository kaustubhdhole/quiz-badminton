This repository now hosts a small brick-breaking game. Open `index.html` in a browser to play.

Use the left and right arrow keys or the mouse scroll wheel to move the skateboard and bounce the football into the bricks. Regular bricks award +10 points, while hidden green bricks give +50 points when hit. Once all bricks are destroyed, a congratulations message displays your final score. The game automatically expands to fill the entire browser window for a full-screen experience.
